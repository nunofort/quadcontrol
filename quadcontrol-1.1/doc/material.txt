NOTE: you need 2 props to rotate clockwise(CW-R) and 2 counter clockwise (CCW-L) at least
      Should by some spares for each type
      Connect 2 opposite motors to ESCs (CW-R) yellow and red connectors in one way
      Connect 2 opposite motors to ESCs (CCW-L) yellow and red connect in another way
      to invert the motor rotation

You can get these materials with other specs for more powerfull quadcopter.
(as an example, big alluminum home made frame with powerfull motors)

For the battery you can get one 3S from 11.1V with at least 5000mAh, for testing.
It is recommended a 4S battery for more time to play with.

Optionally and recommended, add one separate battery bank for the PI.
